## Background And Motivation

Do you currently use more than one app to track your exercise regiment? Are you tired of those developers modifying pricing/subscription structures or placing ads in between you and getting fit? Do app updates lose features that you came to rely on in your workouts?

I sure know I answered yes to all those questions. Swole Nation is an open-source fitness application that aims to help you manage and track your fitness progression. I am combining ideas and features I used across multiple exercise apps into one ad-free app that suits my exercise needs. 

To start out, the alpha version of Swole Nation will only include workouts from the "Texas Method", a grouping of five compound barbell exercises structured in a way to build strength quickly and effectively. In future versions, more workouts will be added as well as more features related to tracking your progress throughout your fitness journey.

Features:
- Workouts that help you build strength quickly
- Animations of proper form for each exercise
- Background voice reminders of when to do the next set
- Timers for set and workout duration
- Weight plate calculator for barbell exercises
- Ways to customize and transform your workouts

## Roadmap

As Swole Nation is still in early alpha testing, the roadmap will be hard to pin down until more testing is done. I can tell you that I want to expand the app to include exercises that have a count-down timer (e.g. planks) and work better with exercises that only have one set.

The other goal is to place workouts, exercises, and sessions in an online repository so that users can add and edit their workouts in the cloud on a laptop, if they choose to do so.

Ideally, this app will replace all the exercise apps I currently use, so any missing features will be included until I reach that holy grail.

## Develop Locally

Like a normal React Native app, you can run this app locally via the scripts in `package.json`.
