## Background And Motivation

Do you currently use more than one app to track your exercise regiment? Are you tired of those developers modifying pricing/subscription structures or placing ads in between you and getting fit? Do app updates lose features that you came to rely on in your workouts?

I sure know I answered yes to all those questions. Swole Nation is an open-source fitness application that aims to help you manage and track your fitness progression. I am combining ideas and features I used across multiple exercise apps into one ad-free app that suits my exercise needs. 

To start out, the alpha version of Swole Nation will only include workouts from the "Texas Method", a grouping of five compound barbell exercises structured in a way to build strength quickly and effectively. In future versions, more workouts will be added as well as more features related to tracking your progress throughout your fitness journey.

Features:
- Workouts that help you build strength quickly
- Animations of proper form for each exercise
- Background voice reminders of when to do the next set
- Timers for set and workout duration
- Weight plate calculator for barbell exercises
- Ways to customize and transform your workouts
